//         question: "An 18-year-old man is involved in a severe motor vehicle crash. He is rushed to surgery for an emergent laparotomy. Unfortunately, he undergoes a complete pancreatectomy, which will have all of the following consequences except for which one?",
//         options: [
//             "Failure to convert pepsinogen into pepsin",
//             "Diabetes",
//             "Increased likelihood of duodenal ulcer formation",
//             "Decreased synthesis of trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen"
//         ],
//         correctOption: "Failure to convert pepsinogen into pepsin",
//         explanation: "Patients who undergo a pancreatectomy suffer from many debilitating conditions, including diabetes due to the inability to secrete or produce insulin, increased likelihood of duodenal ulcers from the absence of bicarbonate secretion, and decreased ability to absorb fats (due to the lack of pancreatic lipase), resulting in steatorrhea. Trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen are secreted by the pancreas and will not be present in this patient, resulting in poor protein digestion. Pepsinogen is activated to pepsin in the stomach by the release of HCl by the parietal cells, which is not affected by the removal of the pancreas."
